\file   SpaceNavDevice.h
\brief  Driver for the SpaceNavigator device made by 3DConnexion.
This also works for other similar devices, like the SpacePilot,
although it only supports 2 buttons and 6DOF input from the
hockey puck thingy.

OSX Setup: The current implementation only works on OSX and
requires you to install 3DConnexion's SDK framework, which
is packaged with their latest OSX driver.  Then, add
"3DconnexionClient" to the FRAMEWORKS variable in your
Makefile to link with the SDK.
